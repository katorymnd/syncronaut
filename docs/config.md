# Configuration

Syncronaut offers flexible configuration adapted to your workflow.  
Most settings are stored in your **AppData roaming folder** and applied automatically each time you launch the app.

## Default Paths

- **Windows (Dev mode):**  
  `C:\Users\<YourUser>\AppData\Roaming\syncronaut`

## Key Settings

- **Sync Profiles**  
  Each profile stores a source, destination, and sync strategy (Legacy Sync, Mirror, Fast Sync).  
  

- **Logging**  
  Logs are written to the local config directory by default.  
 

- **Licensing**  
  Your license key is saved in the roaming config folder and works regardless of whether you use the portable or installer edition.
