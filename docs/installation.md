## Verify Integrity (Optional)

For extra security, verify the SHA256 checksum:

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
Get-FileHash Syncronaut-Setup-x.y.z.exe -Algorithm SHA256

```
Compare the output with the published checksums on the download page.

> **Tip:** Use the installer for a smooth setup, or the portable versions if you prefer a no-install workflow.
