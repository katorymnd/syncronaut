Welcome aboard Syncronaut – your cosmic companion for fast, reliable backups.  
In just a few steps, you’ll be syncing like a champion.

## 1. Launch Syncronaut
After installation, open **Syncronaut** from your applications menu (Windows, Linux, or macOS).  
You’ll be greeted by the dashboard where you can create your first sync job.

## 2. Create a Sync Job
- Choose your **Source Folder** (where your files live)  
- Choose your **Backup Folder** (backup target, external drive, or network location)

---

## 3. Choose Sync Mode
Syncronaut offers three primary modes:

- **Legacy Sync** – Copies new/changed files, never deletes, slowly.
- **Fast Sync** – Copies new/changed files, never deletes. The  process  is faster.
- Combine any with **Mirror** – Keeps Backup exactly like source (adds, updates, deletes).  

Pick the one that fits your workflow.

## 4. Run Your First Sync
Hit **Start Sync**.  
You’ll see live progress of files being analyzed and copied, along with a summary at the end.

## 5. Verify Results
When the sync completes, open your Backup folder.  
Your files should be there, neatly mirrored or updated as per your chosen mode.
